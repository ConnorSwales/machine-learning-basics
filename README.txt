Upon cloning from GitHub, you will have some scripts and folders but will be missing some important things



First set up a virtual invironment
    -> pipenv install

Next make sure the interpreter is correct
    -> find interpreter path

Next, create a way to run the files
    -> launch.json


Run setup.py (doesn't actually do anything, just makes a nice print if is all working)
